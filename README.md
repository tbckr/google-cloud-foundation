Toolkit (CFT). Please be aware that this is a personal adaptation and may not suit everyone's needs.

## Overview

This repository consists of Terraform modules and code inspired by
the [Google Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit). The CFT is one
of two reference architectures for the Google Cloud Foundation, which is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and
highly available foundation for running applications in the Google Cloud. The CFT follows the Security-by-Design
principle and incorporates best practices for security, scalability, and high availability.

Here are some useful resources related to the Google Cloud Foundation Toolkit:

- [Terraform Example Foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation): This
  repository serves as the basis for this personal adaptation.
- [Google Cloud Security Foundations Guide](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf):
  Use this guide as a supplementary resource along with the Terraform Example Foundation.

While this repository is opinionated and may not be a one-size-fits-all solution, it can serve as a reference for myself
and others who are interested. I have made an effort to document everything thoroughly, but if you have any questions,
feel free to open an issue, and I will respond as soon as possible.

## Motivation

As someone who has been working with Google Cloud for some time and utilizing the Google Cloud Foundation Toolkit, I
have consistently relied on the Terraform Example Foundation for my projects, tailoring it to meet my specific needs.
Through this guide, my aim is to simplify my workflow and make it easier for others to get started. I have also strived
to enhance the code by minimizing duplications and integrating new concepts and best practices.
