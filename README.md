# My personal, opinionated Google Cloud Foundation

This is my personal, opinionated Google Cloud Foundation. Feel free to use it as a starting point or as a reference for
your own projects.

## What is this?

This is a collection of Terraform modules and examples that I use to deploy my infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform.
It is opinionated, and it is not meant to be a generic solution for everyone. It is meant to be a starting point for
your own projects. It is also meant to be a reference for you to learn from. I have tried to document everything as
much as possible, but if you have any questions, feel free to open an issue. I will try to answer as soon as I can.
