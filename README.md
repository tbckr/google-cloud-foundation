# Opinionated Google Cloud Foundation

This repository contains my customized, opinionated version of the Google Cloud Foundation based on the Cloud Foundation
Toolkit (CFT). Please be aware that this is a personal adaptation and may not suit everyone's needs.

## Overview

This repository consists of Terraform modules and code inspired by
the [Google Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit). The CFT is one
of two reference architectures for the Google Cloud Foundation, which is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and
highly available foundation for running applications in the Google Cloud. The CFT follows the Security-by-Design
principle and incorporates best practices for security, scalability, and high availability.

Here are some useful resources related to the Google Cloud Foundation Toolkit:

- [Terraform Example Foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation): This
  repository serves as the basis for this personal adaptation.
- [Google Cloud Security Foundations Guide](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf):
  Use this guide as a supplementary resource along with the Terraform Example Foundation.

While this repository is opinionated and may not be a one-size-fits-all solution, it can serve as a reference for myself
and others who are interested. I have made an effort to document everything thoroughly, but if you have any questions,
feel free to open an issue, and I will respond as soon as possible.
