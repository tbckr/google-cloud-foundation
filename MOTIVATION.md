# Motivation

As someone who has been working with Google Cloud for some time and utilizing the Google Cloud Foundation Toolkit, I
have consistently relied on the Terraform Example Foundation for my projects, tailoring it to meet my specific needs.
Through this guide, my aim is to simplify my workflow and make it easier for others to get started. I have also strived
to enhance the code by minimizing duplications and integrating new concepts and best practices.
